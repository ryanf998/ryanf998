# Hi, I’m Ryan 👋

I’m a Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo specializing in Financial Analysis and Risk Management, with hands-on experience building data pipelines, automation scripts, and internal tools in regulated, production environments.

My interests sit at the intersection of:
- software engineering
- data & analytics
- financial systems and instruments

## What I’ve worked on
- Automation & data pipelines in Python and R for large-scale financial and economic datasets
- Internal platform tooling & documentation for CRM and advisor-facing systems

### Currently learning
- SDLC – formalizing experience from enterprise feature delivery, including requirements gathering, design reviews, implementation, testing, and release cycles
- APIs and system integrations – designing and documenting RESTful APIs, informed by prior work mapping data flows and platform dependencies
- MEAN stack fundamentals – understanding how frontend, backend, and data layers interact in modern web applications

### Selected Projects
- **TBD** (DeltaHacks 2026)
  
- **SmartSkin** (GeeseHacks 2025) 
  Wearable health monitoring prototype using Arduino + Python, with backend integrations for alerts and risk detection.

- **Data Processing & ETL Scripts**  
  Modular pipelines for cleaning, linking, and validating large datasets in production workflows.

- **Personal Website**  
  A simple static site to experiment with frontend fundamentals and present my artwork.
